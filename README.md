## Catarina's notes

I made this challenge using React and NodeJS. I also installed React DOM.

Made 2 components - the board and the squares. 

I managed to do the squares and the interactions with the 'X' and the 'O's. 

Used React Hooks to have access to the state and to change it everytime a player played/changed. I also implemented the useEffect so we render it everytime a state is updated and we could see if there is a Winner. And if it would do, to send an alert saying "Congrats, you won!"

However, I could not finnish the logic to "check winner". I tried to get some Google help but it was not really working and I didn't figure out how to solve. 

The next steps would be to figure out how to solve this logic for checking the winner, since the rest is working as expected.

Thank you for the challenge!
